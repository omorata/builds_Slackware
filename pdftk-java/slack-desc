# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pdftk-java:
pdftk-java: Pdftk-Java  is a port of pfdtk into Java. The current goal is to make
pdftk-java: a translation as faithful as it is reasonable and to fix any issues
pdftk-java: present in the original (correctness takes precedence over
pdftk-java: compatibility, see the differences), leaving possible improvements
pdftk-java: and refactoring for later. So far all code has been manually
pdftk-java: translated and it passes the test suite of php-pdftk, but a lot more
pdftk-java: testing is needed.
